\section{Quantum Bits}
\label{subsec:qubits}

\subsection{Single Qubit Systems}
\label{subsubsec:qubits}
%Classical computers manipulate bits and the quantum equivalent is called a quantum bit, often abbreviated as qubit.
Classical computers manipulate bits, whereas quantum computer's most fundamental unit is called a quantum bit, often abbreviated as qubit. Bits as well as qubits are binary entities, meaning they can only take the values 0 and 1.

A good example for a physical implementation of a qubit is the single electron of a hydrogen atom sketched in Fig.~\ref{img:qubitatom}. Usually, the electron is found in its ground state which one can define as the \0 state of the qubit. Using a laser pulse the electron can be excited into the next highest valence shell which one can define as the \1 state of the qubit. After some time $t$ the electron will decohere to its ground state (\0) which is called the longitudinal coherence or amplitude damping time and is an important parameter for measuring qubit lifetimes.

A classical non-probabilistic bit can only be in one of the two possible states at once. In contrast, qubits obey the laws of quantum mechanics, which gives rise to the powerful property that - besides being a definite 0 or 1 - they can also be in a superposition of the two states. Mathematically this is expressed as a linear combination of the states 0 and 1:

\begin{equation}
\label{equ: simplequbit}
\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex coefficients ($\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$) and are often referred to as amplitudes. Any amplitude $\eta$ can be further subdivided into a complex phase factor $e^{i\phi}$ and a non-negative real number $e$ such that,


\begin{equation}
\label{equ: amplitude}
\eta = e^{i\phi}e
\end{equation}

In Equ.~\ref{equ: simplequbit}, \0 is the Dirac notation for the qubit being in state 0 and it represents a two-dimensional vector in a complex 2-D vector space (called Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{2}$). \0 and \1 are the computational basis states and they constitute an orthonormal basis of $\mathcal{H}_{2}$. For the sake of clarity, \0 and \1 can be thought of as the 2-D vectors shown below.

APPROXIMATELY EQUAL SIGN!
\begin{equation}
\label{equ: 0and1kets}
\ket{0} =  \colvec{1\\0} \quad \quad \ket{1} = \colvec{0\\1}
\end{equation}

Subbing these vectors into Equ.~\ref{equ: simplequbit} yields the vector representation of $\ket{\psi}$:
\begin{equation}
\label{equ: simplequbitvector}
\ket{\psi} = \alpha \colvec{1\\0} + \beta \colvec{0\\1} = \colvec{\alpha\\\beta}
\end{equation}

In the cases $\alpha = 1$ or $\beta = 1$ there is no quantum behaviour since the qubit is not in a superposition. However, if for example $\alpha = \beta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ the qubit is in an equal quantum superposition which is impossible to achieve with a classical computer. This leads to another important qubit lifetime parameter - the transversal coherence or phase damping time. It is measured by preparing the equal superposition $\frac{\ket{0}+\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$ and due to unavoidable interaction with the environment after some time $t$ the quantum behaviour will be lost and the state will either be a definite \0 or \1. The process of losing quantum behaviour is called \emph{decoherence}.

However, even though a qubit can be in a superposition of \0 and \1, when measured it will take the value \0 with a probability of
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:bornrule0}
Prob(\ket{0}) = {|\alpha|}^{2}
\end{equation}
and \1 with a probability of 
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:bornrule1}
Prob(\ket{1}) = {|\beta|}^{2}
\end{equation}

The fact that the probability of measuring a particular state is equal the absolute value squared of the respective amplitude is called Born rule (citation). Since the total probability of measuring any value has to be 1, the following normalization condition must be satisfied:
\begin{equation}
\label{equ: normalization}
{|\alpha|}^{2} + {|\beta|}^{2} =  1
\end{equation}
Therefore, a qubit is inherently probabilistic but when measured it collapses into a single classical bit (0 or 1). It follows that a measurement destroys information about the superposition of the qubit (the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$). This constitutes one of the main difficulties when designing quantum algorithms since only limited information can be obtained about the final states of the qubits in the quantum computer.

Similar to logic gates in a classical computer, a QC manipulates qubit by means of quantum logic gates which will be introduced in detail in Section~\ref{subsec:quantumlogicgates}. Generally, an arbitrary quantum logic gate U acting on a single qubit state is a linear transformation given by a 2x2 matrix whose action on $\ket{\psi}$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:unitarytransformation}
U \ket{\psi} = \begin{pmatrix}
 a & b \\ 
 c & d
 \end{pmatrix} \colvec{\alpha\\\beta} = \colvec{a*\alpha+b*\beta\\c*\alpha+d*\beta}
\end{equation}

Matrix $U$ must be unitary which means that a) its determinant is equal to unity and b) its Hermitian conjugate $U^\dagger$ must be equal to its inverse (see Equ.~\ref{equ:unitarydef1} and ~\ref{equ:unitarydef2}). All quantum logic gates must be unitary since this preserves the normalization of the qubit state it is acting on.

\begin{align}
\label{equ:unitarydef1}
a)& \mid det(U) \mid = 1 \\ 
\label{equ:unitarydef2}
b)& \quad UU^\dagger = U^\dagger U = \mathbb{1} = UU^{-1} = U^{-1}U
\end{align} 

Using spherical polar coordinates, a single qubit can be visualized on the so-called Bloch sphere by parameterising $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in Equ.~\ref{equ: simplequbit} as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{equ: blochqubit}
\ket{q} = \cos\frac{\theta}{2} \ket{0} + e^{i \phi} \sin\frac{\theta}{2} \ket{1}
\end{equation}

The Bloch sphere has a radius of 1 and is therefore a unit sphere. The \0 qubit state is defined to lie along the positive z-axis ($\hat{z}$) and the \1 state is defined to lie along the negative z-axis ($-\hat{z}$) as labelled in Fig.~\ref{fig:blochsphere}. At this point, it is important to note that these two states are mutually orthogonal in $\mathcal{H}_{2}$ even though they are not orthogonal on the Bloch sphere. 

Qubit states on the Bloch equator such as the $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$ coordinate axes represent equal superpositions where \0 and \1 both have measurement probabilities equal to $0.5$. The $\hat{x}$-axis for example represents the equal superposition $\ket{q} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{0} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{1}$. As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:blochsphere} any arbitrary 2-D qubit state $\ket{\psi}$ can be decomposed into the polar angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ and visualized as a vector on the Bloch sphere. Such an object is called the Bloch vector of the qubit state $\ket{\psi}$. The Bloch sphere will be the main visualization tool for qubit manipulations in this thesis.

\subsection{Multiple Qubit Systems}
\label{subsec:multiplequbitsystems}

A classical computer with one bit of memory is not particularly useful and equally a QC with one qubit is rather useless. In order to be able to perform large and complicated computations many individual qubits need to be combined to create a large QC. When moving from single to multi qubit systems a new mathematical tool, the so-called tensor product (symbol $\otimes$), is needed. A tensor product of two qubits is written as:

\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi} \otimes \ket{\psi} = \ket{0} \otimes \ket{0} = \ket{00}
\end{equation}
 
whereby the last expression omits the $\otimes$ symbol which is the shorthand form of a tensor product between two qubits.

In vector notation a tensor product of two vectors (\textcolor{red}{red} and \textcolor{green}{green}) is defined as shown below:

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:tensor2qubits}
\ket{\textcolor{red}{0}\textcolor{green}{0}} = \textcolor{red}{\ket{0}} \otimes \textcolor{green}{\ket{0}} = \textcolor{red}{\colvec{1\\0}} \otimes \textcolor{green}{\colvec{1\\0}} = \colvec{\textcolor{red}{1}*\textcolor{green}{\colvec{1\\0}}\\\textcolor{red}{0}*\textcolor{green}{\colvec{1\\0}}} = \colvec{1\\0\\0\\0}
\end{equation}

The last expression in Equ.~\ref{equ:tensor2qubits} shows that the two-qubit state $\ket{00}$ is no longer two but four-dimensional. Hence, it lives in a four-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{4}$. A quantum gate acting on multiple qubits can therefore not have the same dimensions as a single-qubit gate (Equ.~\ref{equ:unitarytransformation}) which demands for a new gate formalism for multi qubit systems.

Consider wanting to apply an arbitrary single-qubit gate U (Equ.~\ref{equ:unitarytransformation}) to the first qubit and leaving the second qubit unchanged, essentially applying the identity matrix $\mathbb{1}$ to it. To do this, one defines the tensor product of two matrices as follows,

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:matrixtensorproduct}
\textcolor{red}{U} \otimes \textcolor{green}{\mathbb{1}} =\textcolor{red}{\begin{pmatrix}
 a & b \\ 
 c & d
 \end{pmatrix}} \otimes \textcolor{green}{\begin{pmatrix}
 1 & 0 \\ 
 0 & 1
 \end{pmatrix}} = \begin{pmatrix}
 \textcolor{red}{a}*\textcolor{green}{\begin{pmatrix}
 1 & 0 \\ 
 0 & 1
 \end{pmatrix}} & \textcolor{red}{b}*\textcolor{green}{\begin{pmatrix}
 1 & 0 \\ 
 0 & 1
 \end{pmatrix}} \\ 
 \textcolor{red}{c}*\textcolor{green}{\begin{pmatrix}
 1 & 0 \\ 
 0 & 1
 \end{pmatrix}} & \textcolor{red}{d}*\textcolor{green}{\begin{pmatrix}
 1 & 0 \\ 
 0 & 1
 \end{pmatrix}}
 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
 a & 0 & b & 0 \\ 
 0 & a & 0 & b \\ 
 c & 0 & d & 0 \\ 
 0 & c & 0 & d 
 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

Thus, the result of the tensor product $U \otimes \mathbb{1}$ is a unitary 4x4 matrix which can now be used to linearly transform the 4x1 vector representing the $\ket{00}$ state in Equ.~\ref{equ:tensor2qubits}:

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:2qubitlineartransform1}
U \otimes \mathbb{1} \ket{00} = \begin{pmatrix}
 a & 0 & b & 0 \\ 
 0 & a & 0 & b \\ 
 c & 0 & d & 0 \\ 
 0 & c & 0 & d 
 \end{pmatrix} \colvec{1\\0\\0\\0} = \colvec{a\\0\\c\\0}
\end{equation}

One can also first perform the single qubit operations on the respective qubits followed by the tensor product of the two resulting vectors:

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:2qubitlineartransform2}
(U \otimes \mathbb{1})(\ket{0} \otimes \ket{0})= U\ket{0} \otimes \mathbb{1}\ket{0} = \begin{pmatrix}
 a & b \\ 
 c & d
 \end{pmatrix} \colvec{1\\0} \otimes \begin{pmatrix}
 1 & 0 \\ 
 0 & 1
 \end{pmatrix} \colvec{1\\0} = \colvec{a\\c} \otimes \colvec{1\\0} = \colvec{a\\0\\c\\0}
\end{equation}

This formalism can be extended to any number of qubits and the use of tensor products leads to an exponential increase in the dimensionality of the Hilbert space. Hence, $n$ qubits live in a $2^n$-dimensional Hilbert space ($\mathcal{H}_{2}^{\otimes n}$) and can store the content of $2^n$ classical bits. As an example, only 33 qubits can store the equivalent of $2^{33} = 8,589,934,592$ bits (= 1 gigabyte) which clearly bears the potential for enourmous speed-ups in computations as will be demonstrated later.

Lastly, when considering multi qubit systems one will find composite states that can or cannot be factorized. Consider for example the last expression in Equ.~\ref{equ:2qubitlineartransform2} which can be reexpressed as follows,

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:2qubitreexpressed}
\colvec{a\\0\\c\\0} = a\colvec{1\\0\\0\\0} + 0\colvec{0\\1\\0\\0} + c \colvec{0\\0\\1\\0} + 0\colvec{0\\0\\0\\1} =  a\ket{00} + 0 \ket{01} + c \ket{10} + 0\ket{11}
\end{equation}

This can be factorized into the following tensor product:

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:2qubitfactorized}
a\ket{00} + c \ket{10} = (a\ket{0} + c \ket{1})\otimes \ket{0}
\end{equation}

In contrast, consider the following state:

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:2qubitnonfactorized}
\ket{\phi} = \frac{\ket{00} + \ket{11}}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{equation}

It is straightforward to see that there is no way to factorize the state $\ket{\phi}$ into a tensor product of two states.
Now imagine, two people Andy and Beatrice are given two electrons prepared in the quantum state $\ket{\phi}$. Andy keeps the first electron in the lab and Beatrice takes the second electron to her house. Andy gets interested in measuring if his electron is in the $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$ state and performs a measurement. He finds the electron to be in the $\ket{1}$ state. From Equ.~\ref{equ:2qubitnonfactorized} and knowing that measurement collapses a superposition the post-measurement (PM) state $\ket{\phi}_{PM}$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:2qubitcollapsed}
\ket{\phi}_{PM} = \ket{11}
\end{equation}

Looking at this expression tells Andy that Beatrice's electron must be in state $\ket{1}$ as well without having measured her electron! Even more suprising is the fact that the second electron was nowhere close to Andy and he was still able to determine its state. 

Non-local correlations between qubit measurement outcomes is a peculiar quantum property of non-factorising quantum states and is called \emph{entanglement}. It is an integral part of quantum computation and Section~\ref{subsubsubsec:cnotgate} will give a concrete example of how to create such a state in a QC.

%%%%% SECTION: Q LOGIC GATES


\section{Quantum Logic Gates}
\label{subsec:quantumlogicgates}
In order to perform quantum computations, tools, analogous to the classical logic gates, are needed for qubit manipulation. Quantum logic gates are square matrices that can be visualized as rotations on the Bloch sphere. The following subsections will introduce the major single and multi qubit logic gates.

\subsection{Single Qubit Gates}
\label{subsubsec:singlequbitgates} 

\subsubsection{Qubit Flip (X) Gate}
\label{subsubsubsec:xgate}

The quantum equivalent of the classical NOT logic gate is called X gate and is given by the 1\textsuperscript{st} Pauli matrix:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{1} = X = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 & 1 \\ 
 1 & 0
 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}


The action of a quantum gate on the arbitrary qubit state $\ket{\psi}$ (Equ.~\ref{equ: simplequbitvector}) can be analysed using the gate's matrix and the qubit's vector representation. Applying some straightforward linear algebra yields:

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:xverification1}
X \otimes \ket{\psi} = X \otimes (\alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}) = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 & 1 \\ 
 1 & 0
 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
 \alpha  \\ 
 \beta
 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
 \beta  \\ 
 \alpha
 \end{pmatrix} = \beta \ket{0} + \alpha \ket{1}
\end{equation}

Thus, applying the X gate to qubit state $\ket{\psi}$ swaps the amplitudes of \0 and \1. More specifically, applying X to the \0 state results in the \1 state,

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:xverification2}
X \otimes \ket{0} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 & 1 \\ 
 1 & 0
 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
 1  \\ 
 0
 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0  \\ 
 1 \end{pmatrix} =  \ket{1}
\end{equation}

In terms of the example with the electron of a hydrogen atom shown in Fig.~\ref{img:qubitatom} an X gate can be implemented by exciting the electron from the ground state ($\ket{0}$) into the next highest electron valence shell ($\ket{1}$) using a controlled laser pulse.

%consider the qubit initially being in state \0. Applying an X gate will flip the qubit into the \1 state which can be implemented in the lab by exciting the electron into the next highest electron valence shell using a controlled laser pulse.

The \0 state is recovered when applying X again to the \1 state,

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:xverification3}
X \otimes \ket{1} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 & 1 \\ 
 1 & 0
 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
 0  \\ 
 1
 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
 1  \\ 
 0 \end{pmatrix} =  \ket{0}
\end{equation}

On the Bloch sphere, the X gate corresponds to an anti-clockwise $\pi$ rotation around the x-axis as shown in Fig.~\ref{img:blochxgate}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/blochxgate.png}
   \caption{Visualization of the X gate on the Bloch sphere. Initial state (black) transformed to final state (red).}
   \label{img:blochxgate}
\end{figure}

From Equ.~\ref{equ:xverification1},~\ref{equ:xverification2} and~\ref{equ:xverification3} it follows that X is its own inverse as well as its own Hermitian conjugate:
\begin{align}
XX &= XX^\dagger = \mathbb{1} \\
X &= X^{-1} = X^\dagger
\end{align}

The action, circuit \& matrix representation and Bloch sphere visualization for the most important single-qubit quantum logic gates are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:singlequbitgates}  below.

%%%%% SUBSECTION: MULTIPLE Q LOGIC GATES


\subsection{Multiple Qubit Gates}
\label{subsubsec:multiqubitgates}

\subsubsection{Controlled NOT Gate}
\label{subsubsubsec:cnotgate}

The most important two-qubit quantum gate is the controlled NOT or CNOT gate given by the following 4x4 matrix:
\begin{equation}
CNOT = \begin{pmatrix}
 \mathbb{1} & 0 \\ 
 0 & X
 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The CNOT gate takes two qubits, a control and a target qubit, as input. If and only if the control qubit is in the \1 state, the NOT (X) gate is applied to the target qubit. In equations, the CNOT will always be followed by parantheses containing the control (c) qubit followed by the target (t) qubit: CNOT(c,t). The input-output relation (truth table) for the CNOT gate is given in Table~\ref{tab:cnottruthtable} below.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
\caption{CNOT truth table with first qubit as control, second qubit as target.}\vspace{1ex}
\label{tab:cnottruthtable}
\begin{tabular}{llccc}\hline
Input & Output \\ \hline
00 & 00 \\
01 & 01 \\
10 & 11 \\
11 & 10 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

To demonstrate the usefulness of the CNOT gate consider starting with two unentangled qubits both in the \0 state,

\begin{equation}
\ket{\phi} = \ket{0} \otimes \ket{0} = \ket{00}
\end{equation}

Applying the H gate onto the first qubit yields the following (still unentangled) state:

\begin{equation}
(H \otimes \mathbb{1}) \ket{\phi} = (H \otimes \mathbb{1}) \ket{00} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{00} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{10} 
\end{equation}

Now consider applying the CNOT to this state whereby the control qubit is coloured \textcolor{red}{red} and the target qubit \textcolor{green}{green}.

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:cnotexamples}
CNOT(\textcolor{red}{0},\textcolor{green}{1}) \otimes (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{\textcolor{red}{0}\textcolor{green}{0}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{\textcolor{red}{1}\textcolor{green}{0}}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{\textcolor{red}{0}\textcolor{green}{0}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\mathbb{1} \otimes X) \ket{\textcolor{red}{1}\textcolor{green}{0}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{\textcolor{red}{0}\textcolor{green}{0}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{\textcolor{red}{1}\textcolor{green}{1}}
\end{equation}

The last expression in Equ.~\ref{equ:cnotexamples} was used as an example (Equ.~\ref{equ:2qubitnonfactorized}) for entanglement in Section~\ref{subsec:multiplequbitsystems} and it is one of the famous Bell states which are a set of four maximally entangled states (CITATION). Thus, this example demonstrates how the CNOT gate is crucial for the generation of entangled states since it applies the X gate to a qubit depending on the state of a second qubit.

The three most important multi qubit quantum gates CNOT, Toffoli and nCNOT are characterised in Table~\ref{tab:multiqubitgates}.

\section{Classical Machine Learning}
\label{subsec:classicalmachinelearning}

Machine learning can be subdivided into three major fields.

\begin{redbox}
Supervised ML\\
- Based on \emph{input} and \emph{output} data\\
"I know how to classify this data but I need the algorithm to do the computations for me."
\end{redbox}
\begin{greenbox}
Unsupervised ML\\
- Based on \emph{input} data only\\
"I have no clue how to classify this data, can the algorithm create a classifier for me?"
\end{greenbox}
\begin{bluebox}
Reinforcement learning\\
- Based on \emph{input} data only\\
"I have no clue how to classify this data, can the algorithm classify this data and I'll give it a reward if it's correct or I'll punish it if it's not."
\end{bluebox}

This thesis is focussing on quantum-enhancements in the field of supervised machine learning only.

\subsection{k-nearest Neighbour Algorithm}
\label{subsubsec:knearestneighbour}

Understanding the quantum version of the distance weighted $k$-nearest neighbour (kNN) algorithm as described in \cite{Schuld2014} requires prior knowledge of the classical version of the algorithm that will be introduced in this subsection.

Imagine working for a search engine company and you are given the task of classifying unknown pictures of fruits as either apples or bananas. To train your classification algorithm you are given 5 different pictures of apples and 5 different pictures of bananas and will be called the \emph{training data set} ${D}_{T}$. The pictures in ${D}_{T}$ may be taken from different angles, in varying light settings and include different coloured apples and bananas. Two examples of such pictures are shown in Fig.~\ref{img:appleandbanana}.

Most of the time, using the full pixel representation of each picture for classification does not lead to optimal results. Therefore, the next step is to select a certain number of characteristic \emph{features} extracted from the pictures in the training set that can be used to differentiate apples from bananas. Such features might be the RGB value of the most frequent pixel colour since bananas and apples have different colour spectra or a measure of the curvature of the main object in the picture since an apple is almost spherical whereas a banana looks more like a bend line. Through the selection \& extraction of features the dimension of the training data set is drastically reduced from a few thousand pixels to a handful of features. The $m$ extracted features for the j\textsuperscript{th} picture are stored in the $m$-dimensional \emph{feature vector} $\vec{v}_{j}$.

Mathematically, the training data set ${D}_{T}$ consists of ten feature vectors $\vec{v}_{0}, \vec{v}_{1},..,\vec{v}_{10}$ that are each assigned to either class $A$ (apple) or $B$ (banana). The training vectors are visualized as yellow and purple circles in Fig.~\ref{fig:knnconcept}.

The kNN algorithm is a non-parametric classifier that given a new unclassified input vector $\vec{x}$ (red star in Fig.~\ref{fig:knnconcept}) considers the $k$ nearest neighbours within the training set (using a predefined measure of distance) and classifies $\vec{x}$, based on a majority vote, as either $A$ or $B$. Thereby, $k$ is a positive integer, usually chosen to be small and its value determines the classification outcome. Namely, in the case $k = 3$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:knnconcept}, vector $\vec{x}$ will be classified as class B (purple) but in the case $k = 6$ it will be labelled class A (yellow).

In the case of $k = 10$, $\vec{x}$ would simply be assigned to the class with the most members. In this case, the training vectors should be given distance-dependent weights (such as $\frac{1}{distance}$) to increase the influence of closer vectors over more distant ones.

\subsection{Algorithmic complexity}
\label{subsubsec:algcomplexity}

\subsubsection{Big-O Notation}
\label{subsubsubsec:bigO}

CITATIONS!
In the fields of computer science and quantum information, the so-called Big-O notation is often used to describe how the limiting behaviour of an algorithm depends on variables such as the number of input vectors and their size for example.

\begin{redbox}
\textbf{Formal definition of Big-O}\\
\newline
For any monotonic functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ defined on a subset of the real numbers (${\rm I\!R}$), one says that $f(x) = \mathcal{O}(g(x))$ if and only if when there exists constants $c \geq 0$ and $n_0 \geq 0$ such that

\begin{equation}
\mid f(x) \mid \quad \leq \quad c\text{ }*\mid g(x) \mid \quad \text{for all } n \geq n_0
\end{equation}

This implies that the function $f(x)$ does not grow at a faster rate than $g(x)$, or in other words that function $g(x)$ is an upper bound for the function $f(x)$, for all $n\rightarrow \infty$.
\end{redbox}
