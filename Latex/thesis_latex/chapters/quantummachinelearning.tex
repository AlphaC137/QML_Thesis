\subsection{Quantum k-nearest Neighbour Algorithm}
\label{subsubsec:quantumknearestneighbour}

Hereby, the advantages of the quantum version are the parallel computation of the distances between each training vector and the input vector as well as contracting distance computation and distance weighting into one computational step.

\subsection{Quantum State Preparation Algorithms}
\label{subsubsec:quantumstatepreparation}

Grover \& Rudolph

Diffusion matrix from quantum random walks

Trugenberger et al.

Schack paper Maria mentioned but which I haven't used and looked at.
