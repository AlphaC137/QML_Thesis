# QML_Thesis

This repo contains almost all files that I used for my bachelor thesis research on Quantum Machine Learning at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa.

# Short summary what you can find in the respective subfolders:

Books_and_Resources:
- contains some relevant publications & books about quantum computing, quantum machine learning and quantum gate decompositions

IBM_larger_gates:
- contains a few screenshots of gate decompositions in IBM's quantum composer

java_Bloch_sphere:
- contains a Java applet for Bloch sphere visualization
- this applet was taken from http://eecs.ceas.uc.edu/~mcahay/blochsphere/

Latex:
- contains the latex files for my bachelor research proposal, full bachelor thesis, bachelor defence (presentation), my QIPCC talk as well as I. Chuang's qasm2circ codebase

Octave:
- contains some Octave code for gate decompositions and parameter calculations

Python Code:
- contains code for probability calculations, bloch sphere plotting, gate decompositions, distance calculations and much more...

Quantum_Compiler:
- this code is taken from Paul Pham from http://quantum-compiler.org
- executes the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm for SU2 and SU4 quantum gates

qutip:
- contains the python qutip library

Please let me know if you could make any use of this big mess of files!
I would be very happy to hear from you and I am willing to answer any type of question.
